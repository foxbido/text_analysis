<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>I<small>T</small> had been my habit, I am now aware, to speak somewhat lightly of the
labors of anthologists: to insinuate that they led lives of bland
sedentary ease. I shall not do so again. When the publisher suggested a
collection of representative contemporary essays, I thought it would be
the most lenient of tasks. But experience is a fine aperitive to the
mind.</p>

<p>Indeed the pangs of the anthologist, if he has conscience, are
burdensome. There are so many considerations to be tenderly weighed;
personal taste must sometimes be set aside in view of the general plan;
for every item chosen half a dozen will have been affectionately conned
and sifted; and perhaps some favorite pieces will be denied because the
authors have reasons for withholding permission. It would be enjoyable
(for me, at any rate) to write an essay on the things I have lingered
over with intent to include them in this little book, but have finally
sacrificed for one reason or another. How many times듮wenty at least듈
have taken down from my shelf Mr. Chesterton's <i>The Victorian Age in
Literature</i> to reconsider whether his ten pages on Dickens, or his
glorious summing-up of Decadents and 쿕thetes, were not absolutely
essential. How many times I have palpitated upon certain passages in
<i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> and in Mr. Wells's <i>Outline of History</i>,
which, I assured myself, would legitimately stand as essays if shrewdly
excerpted.</p>

<p>But I usually concluded that would not be quite fair. I have not been
overscrupulous in this matter, for the essay is a mood rather than a
form; the frontier between the essay and the short story is as
imperceptible as is at present the once famous Mason and Dixon line.
Indeed, in that pleasant lowland country between the two empires lie (to
my way of thinking) some of the most fertile fields of prose듡iction
that expresses feeling and character and setting rather than action and
plot; fiction beautifully ripened by the lingering mild sunshine of the
essayist's mood. This is fiction, I might add, extremely unlikely to get
into the movies. I think of short stories such as George Gissing's, in
that too little known volume <i>The House of Cobwebs</i>, which I read again
and again at midnight with unfailing delight; fall asleep over; forget;
and again re-read with undiminished satisfaction. They have no
brilliance of phrase, no smart surprises, no worked-up 'situations'
which have to be taken at high speed to pass without breakdown over
their brittle bridgework of credibility. They have only the modest and
faintly melancholy savor of life itself.</p>

<p>Yet it is a mere quibble to pretend that the essay does not have easily
recognizable manners. It may be severely planned, or it may ramble in
ungirdled mood, but it has its own point of view that marks it from the
short story proper, or the merely personal memoir. That distinction,
easily felt by the sensitive reader, is not readily expressible. Perhaps
the true meaning of the word <i>essay</i>드n attempt듢ives a clue. No
matter how personal or trifling the topic may be, there is always a
tendency to generalize, to walk round the subject or the experience, and
view it from several vantages; instead of (as in the short story)
cutting a carefully landscaped path through a chosen tract of human
complication. So an essay can never be more than an attempt, for it is
an excursion into the endless. Any student of fiction will admit that in
the composition of a short story many entertaining and valuable
elaborations may rise in the mind of the author which must be strictly
rejected because they do not forward the essential motive. But in the
essay (of an informal sort) we ask not relevance to plot, but relevance
to mood. That is why there are so many essays that are mere marking
time. The familiar essay is easier to write than the short story, but it
imposes equal restraints on a scrupulous author. For in fiction the
writer is controlled and limited and swept along by his material; but in
the essay, the writer rides his pen. A good story, once clearly
conceived, almost writes itself; but essays are written.</p>

<p>There also we find a pitfall of the personal essay듮he temptation to
become too ostentatiously quaint, too deliberately 'whimsical' (the word
which, by loathsome repetition, has become emetic). The fine flavor and
genius of the essay드s in Bacon and Montaigne, Lamb, Hazlitt,
Thackeray, Thoreau; perhaps even in Stevenson들s the rich bouquet of
personality. But soliloquy must not fall into monologue. One might put
it thus: that the perfection of the familiar essay is a conscious
revelation of self done inadvertently.</p>

<p>The art of the anthologist is the art of the host: his tact is exerted
in choosing a congenial group; making them feel comfortable and at ease;
keeping the wine and tobacco in circulation; while his eye is tenderly
alert down the bright vista of tablecloth, for any lapse in the general
cheer. It is well, also, for him to hold himself discreetly in the
background, giving his guests the pleasure of clinching the jape, and
seeking only, by innocent wiles, to draw each one into some
characteristic and felicitous vein. I think I can offer you, in this
parliament of philomaths, entertainment of the most genuine sort; and
having said so much, I might well retire and be heard no more.</p>

<p>But I think it is well to state, as even the most bashful host may do,
just why this particular company has been called together. My intention
is not merely to please the amiable dilettante, though I hope to do that
too. I made my choices, first and foremost, with a view to stimulating
those who are themselves interested in the arts of writing. I have, to
be frank, a secret ambition that a book of this sort may even be used as
a small but useful weapon in the classroom. I wanted to bring it home to
the student that as brilliant and sincere work is being done to-day in
the essay as in any period of our literature. Accordingly the pieces
reprinted here are very diverse. There is the grand manner; there is
foolery; there is straightforward literary criticism; there is pathos,
politics, and the picturesque. But every selection is, in its own way, a
work of art. And I would call the reader's attention to this: that the
greater number of these essays were written not by retired 鹿thetes, but
by practising journalists in the harness of the daily or weekly press.
The names of some of the most widely bruited essayists of our day are
absent from this roster, not by malice, but because I desired to include
material less generally known.</p>

<p>I should apologize, I suppose, for the very informal tone of the
introductory notes on each author. But I conceived the reader in the
r縝e of a friend spending the evening in happy gossip along the shelves.
Pulling out one's favorites and talking about them, now and then reading
a chosen extract aloud, and ending (some time after midnight) by
choosing some special volume for the guest to take to bed with him들n
the same spirit I have compiled this collection. Perhaps the editorial
comments have too much the manner of dressing gown and slippers; but
what a pleasant book this will be to read in bed!</p>

<p>And perhaps this collection may be regarded as a small contribution to
Anglo-American friendliness. Of course when I say Anglo-, I mean Brito-,
but that is such a hideous prefix. Journalists on this side are much
better acquainted with what their professional colleagues are doing in
Britain, than they with our concerns. But surely there should be a
congenial fraternity of spirit among all who use the English tongue in
print. There are some of us who even imagine a day when there may be
regular international exchanges of journalists, as there have been of
scholars and students. The contributions to this book are rather evenly
divided between British and American hands; and perhaps it is not
insignificant that two of the most pleasing items come from Canada,
where they often combine the virtues of both sides.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant task to thank the authors and publishers who have
assented to the reprinting of these pieces. To the authors themselves,
and to the following publishers, I admit my sincere gratitude for the
use of material copyrighted by them:듃oubleday Page and Company for the
extracts from books by John Macy, Stewart Edward White and Pearsall
Smith; Charles Scribner's Sons for Rupert Brooke's <i>Niagara Falls</i>; the
New York <i>Sun</i> for Don Marquis's <i>Almost Perfect State</i>; the George H.
Doran Company for the essays by Joyce Kilmer and Robert Cortes Holliday;
Mr. James B. Pinker for permission to reprint Mr. Conrad's Preface to <i>A
Personal Record</i>; Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., for the essays by H. M.
Tomlinson, A. P. Herbert and Philip Guedalla; Lady Osler for the essay
by the late Sir William Osler; Henry Holt and Company for Thomas Burke's
<i>The Russian Quarter</i>; E. P. Dutton and Company for <i>A Word for Autumn</i>,
by A. A. Milne; the New York <i>Evening Post</i> for the essays by Stuart P.
Sherman and Harry Esty Dounce; Harper and Brothers for Marian Storm's <i>A
Woodland Valentine</i>; Dodd, Mead and Company for Simeon Strunsky's
<i>Nocturne</i>, from his volume <i>Post-Impressions</i>; the Macmillan Company
for <i>Beer and Cider</i>, from Professor Saintsbury's <i>Notes on a Cellar
Book</i>; Longmans Green and Company for Bertrand Russell's <i>A Free Man's
Worship</i>, from <i>Mysticism and Logic</i>; Robert M. McBride and Company for
the selection from James Branch Cabell; Harcourt, Brace and Company for
the essay by Heywood Broun; <i>The Weekly Review</i> for the essays by O. W.
Firkins, Harry Morgan Ayres and Robert Palfrey Utter. The present
ownership of the copyright of the essay by Louise Imogen Guiney I have
been unable to discover. It was published in <i>Patrins</i> (Copeland and
Day, 1897), which has long been out of print. Knowing the purity of my
motives I have used this essay, hoping that it might introduce Miss
Guiney's exquisite work to the younger generation that knows her hardly
at all.</p>

<h2><a name="AMERICAN_LITERATURE" id="AMERICAN_LITERATURE"></a>AMERICAN LITERATURE<br><br>
<i>By</i> <span class="smcap">John Macy</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This vigorous survey of American letters is the first chapter of
John Macy's admirable volume <i>The Spirit of American Literature</i>,
published in 1913드 book shrewd, penetrating and salty, which has
unfortunately never reached one-tenth of the many readers who would
find it permanently delightful and profitable. Mr. Macy has no
skill in vaudeville tricks to call attention to himself: no shafts
of limelight have followed him across the stage. But those who have
an eye for criticism that is vivacious without bombast, austere
without bitterness, keen without malice, know him as one of the
truly competent and liberal-minded observers of the literary scene.</p>

<p>Mr. Macy was born in Detroit, 1877; graduated from Harvard in 1899;
did editorial service on the <i>Youth's Companion</i> and the <i>Boston
Herald</i>; and nowadays lives pensively in Greenwich Village, writing
a good deal for <i>The Freeman</i> and <i>The Literary Review</i>. Perhaps,
if you were wandering on Fourth Street, east of Sixth Avenue, you
might see him treading thoughtfully along, with a wide sombrero
hat, and always troubled by an iron-gray forelock that droops over
his brow. You would know, as soon as you saw him, that he is a man
greatly lovable. I like to think of him as I first saw him, some
years ago, in front of the bright hearth of the charming St.
Botolph Club in Boston, where he was usually the center of an
animated group of nocturnal philosophers.</p>

<p>The essay was written in 1912, before the very real reawakening of
American creative work that began in the 'teens of this century.
The reader will find it interesting to consider how far Mr. Macy's
remarks might be modified if he were writing to-day.</p>

<p><i>The Spirit of American Literature</i> has been reissued in an
inexpensive edition by Boni and Liveright. It is a book well worth
owning.</p></div>

<p>A<small>MERICAN</small> literature is a branch of English literature, as truly as are
English books written in Scotland or South Africa. Our literature lies
almost entirely in the nineteenth century when the ideas and books of<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>
the western world were freely interchanged among the nations and became
accessible to an increasing number of readers. In literature nationality
is determined by language rather than by blood or geography. M.
Maeterlinck, born a subject of King Leopold, belongs to French
literature. Mr. Joseph Conrad, born in Poland, is already an English
classic. Geography, much less important in the nineteenth century than
before, was never, among modern European nations, so important as we
sometimes are asked to believe. Of the ancestors of English literature
"Beowulf" is scarcely more significant, and rather less graceful, than
our tree-inhabiting forebears with prehensile toes; the true progenitors
of English literature are Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Italian, and French.</p>

<p>American literature and English literature of the nineteenth century are
parallel derivatives from preceding centuries of English literature.
Literature is a succession of books from books. Artistic expression
springs from life ultimately but not immediately. It may be likened to a
river which is swollen throughout its course by new tributaries and by
the seepages of its banks; it reflects the life through which it flows,
taking color from the shores; the shores modify it, but its power and
