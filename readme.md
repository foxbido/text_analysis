This project will try to structurize pure text file. A piece of article will be the basic item unit, and attached to each **unit** is the info card, contains information like author of this article, editor of the published text, release date, etc,.

# goal
Mainly for practising text analysing of Python, for sake of the project I first want to apply the popular methodology in literary text analysing, e.g., TF-IDF, machine learning, deep learning, sort of things and see what I can get from such small a corpus (br, eap, ggb and jj). During this process, I want to see if I can sort out any **general principles** maybe a further expanding of the corpus is necessary.
For the second, I somewhat want to find THE factor that can be decisive when recognizing a segment of text. And possibly some NLP techniques will be needed, or if the factor is totally novel, I may have to develope it from scratch, and the eventual form can be merely a statistical value calculated from the recognized texts of the author, or it can be a set of processes which consequently generate distinguishable pattern(s).

Before both of the goals, firstly I have to structurize the text, that alone already is a big project, and I have a project **Gutentag** for reference.
